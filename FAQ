Section 1. Qt Versions
======================

Q1.1: Does SoQt work with Qt < 2.0?

A:    We have basically dropped trying to support Qt 1.*, but if we can help
      it we will apply patches (within reason) to keep the Qt 1.x support
      alive.


Q1.2: Does SoQt work with Qt 2.*?

A:    Yes, the support for the Qt 2.* series is well tested.


Q1.3: Does SoQt work with Qt >= 3.0?

A:    There has been various reports about problems with Qt 3.0, particularly
      the Windows port.   We do use Qt 3.0 on Linux and it seems to work
      well here.


Q1.4: Where is the qt-mt230nc.dll file?

A:    This file is the Windows Qt 2.3.0 NonCommercial Edition DLL, which
      you can fetch from the TrollTech web site (http://www.trolltech.com).


Q1.5: Does SoQt work with the Qt port for Mac OS X/Darwin?

A:    Yes, but we do not provide binary distributions for Mac OS X
      yet.  As with for MS Windows, library builders are expected to
      know their way around on their system and do a a minimum of
      troubleshooting yourself before contacting coin-support.  This
      situation will hopefully be fixed by the end of the year.

      SoQt is BTW not installed as a framework like Coin is.
